                              Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I just told you! You've be killed me ! You don't know how to do any of those. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! No! Don't jump !

                              I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Who am I making this out to? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Who's a real live robot or is that some king of cheesy New Year's costume ?
